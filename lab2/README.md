# Team 15 Lab 2 README Reflections

## Aliza Syed

I annotated the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These annotations break down the legal language into easy-to-understand explanations that show how each amendment protects individual rights in everyday situations.

## Braden Lam

I annotated the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth amendments to the constitution. The annotations I made explain what the amendment does in simpler terms, and how it can impact people.

## Ethan Kusse

I created the basic HTML structure of how each of the articles, amendments, and sections would appear in on the website. A struggle I encountered was the sheer mass of dividing up the content, but this was overcome with smart copy/pasting. I also contributed to the annotations of the sections.

## Jack Zgombic

My contributions included adding all the annotations to the articles. I think the biggest struggle was understanding some of the confusing language used, but for the most part I think it's pretty straightforward. Some research was helpful to clarify some of the meanings and original intentions from when the Constitution was written.

## Gavin Liu

My main contribution to this lab was adding in the History of the constitution. While it was slightly difficult to find ways to summarize all of it into small sections, I figured it out eventually. Obviously, some research was needed, but I think it turned out well. Another struggle was mainly divvying up the work, but we ended up figuring it out in the end.
