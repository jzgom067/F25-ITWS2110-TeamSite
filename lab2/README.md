I created the basic HTML structure of how each of the articles, amendments, and sections would appear in on the website. A struggle I encountered was the sheer mass of dividing up the content, but this was overcome with smart copy/pasting. I also contributed to the annotations of the sections.

My contributions included adding all the annotations to the articles. I think the biggest struggle was understanding some of the confusing language used, but for the most part I think it's pretty straightforward. Some research was helpful to clarify some of the meanings and original intentions from when the Constitution was written.
