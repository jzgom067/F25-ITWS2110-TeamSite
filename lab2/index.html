                            <h2>Fifth Amendment</h2>

                        <article class="section-block card">
                            <p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

                                <em>Annnotation: The Fifth Amendment ensures fairness when someone is accused of a crime. It says you can’t be put on trial for a serious crime without a grand jury first deciding there’s enough evidence. You can’t be tried twice for the same crime (double jeopardy), and you don’t have to answer questions that would make you look guilty (e.g. "pleading the fifth"). It also says the government must follow proper legal steps (due process) and must pay you fairly if it takes your property for public use.</em>

                            <p>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

                                <em>Annotation: The Sixth Amendment protects the rights of people facing criminal charges. It guarantees a speedy and public trial, so cases don’t drag on unfairly or happen in secret. The trial must have an impartial jury from the community where the crime happened. The accused has the right to know the charges, confront witnesses against them, call witnesses in their favor, and have a lawyer for defense.</em>

                            <p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

                                <em>Analysis: The Seventh Amendment ensures that if you sue someone for more than 20$, you have the right to have a Jury in the court room to decide your case. Once a decision has been made, a court can't change or redo the decisions unless it's appealed with legal grounds. They aren't allowed to just reargue the facts. This amendment is important because of how it prevents judges from abusing their power with the jury of random people who in theory wouldn't be biased.</em>

                            <p>Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <em>Analysis: The Eighth amendment prevents the court from making the bail amount an unreasonable price just to keep you locked in jail. It should be a fair amount that directly correlates to the severity of your crime. In addition, the government can't fine excessively large amounts of money as punishment. The fine should be proportional to the offense. Lastly, punishments for crimes can not be barbaric or torturous, and must conform to basic human decency and justice. This amendment is definitely necessary to prevents someone from being excessively punished whether that is financially or physically.</em>

                                <em>Analysis: The Ninth amendment ensures that just because a right isn't stated in the constitution, doesn't mean that those are the only rights people have. This is important to point out because the constitution can't account for every single right from now to the future, and the government can't abuse the fact that some things aren't specifically stated in the constitution.</em>

                                <br/><br/>
                                <em>Analysis: The Tenth amendment basically means that the government only has the powers listed in the constitution, and the rest of the power is given to the states or the people unless it's specifically prohibited. This is a big deal since it gives more freedom to the state government and makes the different states feel more distinct with their individual state laws.</em>

                            <h3>Origins and Creation</h3>
                            <p>The U.S. Constitution was written during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia from May 25 to September 17, 1787. The Convention was called to address the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, which had proven inadequate for governing the new nation. Fifty-five delegates from twelve states (Rhode Island did not attend) participated in the proceedings, with notable figures including George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Constitution was heavily influenced by Enlightenment ideas, particularly those of John Locke, Montesquieu, and others who advocated for separation of powers and individual rights. James Madison, often called the "Father of the Constitution," came prepared with the Virginia Plan, which served as the foundation for much of the final document.</p>

                            <h3>Ratification Process</h3>
                            <p>After the Convention concluded, the Constitution needed to be ratified by nine of the thirteen states to take effect. This led to intense debates between Federalists (who supported ratification) and Anti-Federalists (who opposed it). The Federalist Papers, written by Madison, Hamilton, and John Jay, were crucial in explaining and defending the Constitution's provisions.</p>
                            
                            <p>Delaware was the first state to ratify on December 7, 1787, followed by Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Constitution officially took effect on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify. However, the ratification of Virginia and New York were considered essential for the new government's success.</p>

                            <h3>What the Constitution Is</h3>
                            <p>The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the United States, establishing the framework for the federal government and defining the relationship between the federal government and the states. It consists of a preamble, seven articles, and twenty-seven amendments.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Constitution establishes three branches of government with separate powers: the legislative branch (Congress), the executive branch (President), and the judicial branch (Supreme Court and federal courts). This system of checks and balances ensures that no single branch becomes too powerful.</p>
                            
                            <p>Key principles include federalism (division of power between federal and state governments), individual rights (protected by the Bill of Rights), and the rule of law. The Constitution can be amended, but the process is deliberately difficult, requiring broad consensus across the nation.</p>

                            <p>The Constitution has served as a model for democratic governments worldwide and has proven remarkably durable, lasting over 230 years with only 27 amendments. Its flexibility has allowed the United States to adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining stable governance and protecting individual liberties.</p>
